# react-interview
* labels are frozen to top row and first column
* uses standard labeling (i.e. letters for columns, numbers for rows)
* numbers are converted into USD and rounded for display, value is preserved
* improved performance by rendering `div` instead of `input` when inputs are not required

TODO:
* fix horizontal scrolling, causing column label alignment issues
* labels not frozen
* scales poorly
